/*
Put type definitions for third-party libraries in this directory.

Some libraries include their own definitions. These will be automatically
discovered via the "typings" field in their package.json.

For others, given package "foo" there will often be an "@types/foo" package on
NPM to use as a dev dependency. You can search for them at
https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/

If you need to write your own see
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html

The simplest declaration to allow use of package "foo" is:

declare module 'foo';

That's only suitable for trivial libaries used only once or during initial
testing of a library.
