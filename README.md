# Python Editor Embed

<!-- TODO: Add TypeDoc documentation and add build workflow -->
<!-- <a href="https://microbit-foundation.github.io/python-editor-embed/" class="typedoc-ignore">This documentation is best viewed on the documentation site rather than GitHub or NPM package site.</a> -->

This is a React/JavaScript library for embedding micro:bit Python Editor as an iframe.

It is intended to be used by other Micro:bit Educational Foundation projects
that need to embed Python Editor and, when the API stabilises, to be useful to others
who embed Python Editor.
